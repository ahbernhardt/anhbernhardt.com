                My name is <span className="name">Anh Nguyen</span>, a software engineer graduate student based in Minneapolis, MN specializing in building (and occasionally designing) exceptional websites, applications, and everything in between.

          <Content>
            As a software engineer, I enjoy bridging the gap between engineering and design â€” combining my technical knowledge with my keen eye for design to create a beautiful product.
            I focus primarily on building, prototyping and implementing user interfaces that are usable and scalable for any web-based platform.{' '}
            <a href="https://codepen.io/ah_nguyen0208" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">I enjoy experimenting</a> and
            <a href="https://github.com/anguyen0208" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> building out</a> with new tools.

            <p>When I'm not in front of a computer screen, I'm probably camping, researching new local restaurants, building LEGO, or crossing off another item on my bucket list and share photos on <a href="https://www.instagram.com/ah_nguyen0208" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Instagram</a>.</p>
